\section{introduction}
Blockwise versions of the Cholesky decomposition are well-known \textcite{Choi1996} and have been complemented through incremental versions recently \textcite{Polok2013}
 

Recently, an incremental algorithm for singular value decomposition has been proposed \textcite{Iodice2022}.
